# LOG_001 : SYSTEM GENESIS & RESTRUCTURING

## DATE: 2026-01-01
## STATUS: ARCHIVED
## TOPIC: MONOLITH TO MULTI-REPO TRANSITION

---

### SUMMARY

As of this cycle, the ZYB ecosystem has completed its transition from a monolithic architecture to a distributed repository system. This move was necessitated by the increasing complexity of our cryptographic primitives and the need for independent verification cycles.

### ARCHITECTURAL SHIFT

The previous structure imposed a high cognitive load on researchers. By decoupling the `kernel` from the `circuits` and `apps`, we have achieved:

1.  **Isolation of Concerns:** Changes in the UI (`zyb-apps`) no longer trigger CI pipelines for the Prover (`zyb-compute`).
2.  **Security Boundaries:** Strict access control for the `zyb-kernel` repository.
3.  **Parallel Research:** Separate teams can now iterate on `zyb-chain` (Aptos/Solana) without blocking the core FHE development.

### TECHNICAL TOPOLOGY

The ecosystem is now segmented into 4 layers:
- **Layer 0 (Foundation):** Kernel & Platform.
- **Layer 1 (Logic):** Circuits, Compute, Chain.
- **Layer 2 (Services):** Backend & Storage.
- **Layer 3 (UX):** SDKs, CLI, Apps.

### NEXT STEPS

We are initiating research into **FHE-based Proof of Innocence (PoI)**. This will be the primary focus for the `zyb-compute` and `zyb-circuits` vectors in the coming weeks.
